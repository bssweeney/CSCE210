Program #3 README

What Works?

Everything in my wheel works correctly. Very cool stuff!!!!

Is you P3 Quality code?

I have Javadoc for everything and I have good variable names. I do have one kind of large
method, whenever I tried to make it into smaller ones it would mess up my program. 
So i just stuck with the larger method that I knew worked.
